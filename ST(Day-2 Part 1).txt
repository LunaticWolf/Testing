Fundamentals of Test Strategy and Test Plan



		History
			of Testing ==> 

					Debugging Oriented
					Demostration Orientation
					Destruction Orientation(1970/80)
								-No Common Approach(afterward Came up with the modern testing approach)

								QAI(Quality Assurance Institute) - US
								ISTQB(International Software Testing Qualifications Board)- UK --> Provides Certification and standards for modern testing.	

					Evaluation Orientation >> uses validators only
								- Used Common Approach

					Prevention Orientation >> uses verifiers and validators







 #Test Strategy

			#Note - In SDLC for a soft, sys. testing has to be done at least once.

	
	System Apps -> Fresh App(from the scratch) --Types of testing to perform --> Sys. Testing(Mandatory) + others(depending upon the req's)
			Maintenance App -- Type of tests to perform --> "Regression Testing for the new added req."

									Regression Testing - used to check the functionality of newly added req.
												verify its affects over old.

											Suppose R5 is added to R1,R2,R3,R4
													So we perform regg. over R5 and verify its affects over others using "Impact Analysis"



			Strategy --> Choose the +=
							Types of Testing
  		
							Levels of testing ->    Start(initial cond's)
										Entry
										Suspension 
										Resumption
										Exit
										Stop -> Acceptance Criteria







#Test Plan 

		
		Plan 	
		Set MileStone
		Resources
		Schedule
		Risk Analysis - analyse risk involved
		Contigency Plan - back ups
		Mitigation Plan

			Create a Master Doc.(ts tp)
