Fundamentals Of Test Cases

		Doc's Preparation --> 
					Updating test Log --> for Passed and Failed test cases

					Defect Log --> only for failed Test cases


		Terms ==> 
				Status TC - 
				Pass / Fail --> Pass only of all checked
				Blocked --> eg. - if Login Module failed
				In Progress
				In-Complete  






Testing --> Manual V/s Automatically(Tools)


	Manual >> - tests are executed manually by a QA Analysts.
		  - performed to discover bugs in software under development.
 	  	  - tester checks all the essential features of the given application or software.
   	 	  - the software testers execute the test cases and generate the test reports without the help of any automation software testing tools.
		  - Sys. Testing 


	Automation T.? >> - testers write code/test scripts to automate test execution. 
			  - Testers use appropriate automation tools to develop the test scripts and validate the software.
			  - relies on the pre-scripted test which runs automatically to compare actual result with the expected results.
			  - Regression Testing.


	Diff's between M & A >>
				executed by QA/script execution , slow/fast



	Types of Testing Tools >>
					Test Management tools - TET(Test Env. ToolKit), TETware, Test Manager, RTH

					Functional Testing Tools - Selenium, Soapui, Watir, HTTP::Recorder, WatiN, Canoo WebTest, Webcorder, Solex, Imprimatur
									SAMIE, Swete ,ITP, WET, WebInject, Katalon Studio
				
					Load Testing Tools - JMeter, FunkLoad
  



	Test Management Tool --> 
				- Identify & Collect Test Req.
				- Plan 
					-Release
						-Cycles...


				- Prepare Test cases 
				- Execute Test Cases
				- Prepare Defect Log.
				- Prepare/Update RTM 
				- Prepare Test Rummary Report
				- Prepare Test Closure Report.

								eg - ALM(HP) - Application LifeCycle Management.




	Use of RTM --> 

			Requirement Coverage --> All the req's present in the soft. has been tested or not(at least once).
						 eg. RTM

			Test Coverage -->  All the test cases prepared for the testing the soft has been executed or not.


			RTM Template - > Sno. Req ID, Req description, TS-id, TC-id, Defect ID
